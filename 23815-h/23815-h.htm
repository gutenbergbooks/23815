<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

<p>Says <i>The Times</i>:&mdash;"It used to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>

tradition of British Liberal statesmanship
to support, without prospect of
immediate advantage, the cause of
nationality and freedom abroad.... It
would at least be showing some interest
to send a minister to Durazzo."
Here, perhaps, is a post for poor Mr.
<span class="sc">Masterman</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>The Kerry News</i> states that it prefers
pigs to Englishmen. This
seems a queer&mdash;almost an
ungracious&mdash;way of expressing
its desire for a Home
Rule Government.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Oil has been discovered in
Somaliland, and it is
rumoured that the Government
is at last about to
realise that its obligations
to our friendlies demand a
forward move against the
<span class="sc">Mullah</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Futurism is apparently
spreading to the animal
world. The following advertisement
appeared in a recent
issue of <i>Lloyd's</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Dyer</span>&mdash;Fancy Color Dyer
for Ostrich required."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>There is a dispute, we see,
as to who invented Revues.
But, even if the responsibility
be fixed, the guilty party,
we have no doubt, will go
scot-free.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The inhabitants of Bugsworth
in Derbyshire, are,
<i>The Mail</i> tells us, dissatisfied
with the name of their village.
A former parish councillor
has suggested that it
shall be changed to Buxworth,
on the ground that it was once a great
hunting centre, and took its name from
the buck, which used to be found in
great numbers there. The present
name has also a distinct suggestion of
the chase about it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Extract, from a speech by Colonel
<span class="sc">Seely</span> on the recent Army crisis:&mdash;"The
only difference is that I am
&pound;5,000 a year poorer.... I am not
less Liberal but more Liberal after
what has happened." To be more
liberal after suffering financially does
the ex-War Minister credit.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The fees charged by beauty doctors
are tending to become more exorbitant
than ever. To have his eyes darkened,
Mr. <span class="sc">George Mitchell</span>, of Bolton, had
to pay <span class="sc">M. Carpentier</span>, of Paris, no
less than &pound;100.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Old horse tramway-cars are being
offered by the London County Council
for sale at from &pound;3 to &pound;5 each. They
are suitable for transformation into
bungalows, tool-sheds, sanatoria and
the like.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Last week, at Bristol, eleven brothers
named <span class="sc">Hunt</span>, of Pucklechurch, played
a football match against a team composed
of the <span class="sc">Miller</span> family, of Brislington.
We are always pleased to see
these practical object-lessons in the
advantage of having large families&mdash;a
custom which is in danger of falling
into desuetude.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"The Liberal Party, the Tory Party,
and the House of Lords are nothing
against the united intelligence of democracy,"
said Mr. <span class="sc">Ramsay MacDonald</span>
at a meeting to celebrate the
"coming of age" of the Independent
Labour Party. We are of the opinion
that Mr. <span class="sc">Ramsay MacDonald</span> should
know better than to impose upon
youth like that. <i>Maxima debetur pueris
reverentia.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>According to <i>The Evening News'</i>
critique of the exhibition of the International
Society:&mdash;"Two statues by
Rodin dominate the gallery. One,
'Benediction,' is in his early manner,
but by Lord Howard de Walden." We
suspect that there was division of
labour here. <span class="sc">Rodin</span> sculped it (in his
early manner) and Lord <span class="sc">Howard de
Walden</span> said, "Bless you" (probably
in his later manner).</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>New York Suffragettes have been
discussing the question,
"Ought women to propose?"
and one of them has stated,
"I am seriously thinking of
proposing to a man"&mdash;and
now, we suspect, she is wondering
why her male acquaintances
are shy about stopping
to talk to her. We ought
to add that her name, as
reported, is Miss <span class="sc">Bonnie
Ginger</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We hear that, as a result
of a contemporary drawing
attention to Chicago's
leniency towards women murderers,
ladies whose hobby is
homicide are now flocking to
that city and it is becoming
uncomfortably overcrowded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>"Frau Krupp von Bohlen,"
we are told, "is the largest
payer of war tax in Germany.
Her contribution amounts to
&pound;440,000." We have a sort
of idea, however, that she gets
some of this back.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span><h2>POLITICS ON THE LINKS.</h2>

<p>I put down my morning paper as I
left the train for the golf club. It contained
the interesting news that the
Parliamentary Golf Handicap had been
postponed lest fiery politicians should
run amok with their clubs. I sighed, for
the spectacle of <span class="sc">Bonar</span> v. <span class="sc">Bogey</span> (The
<span class="sc">Chancellor</span>) would have beaten the
<span class="sc">Mitchell-Carpentier</span> fight. Then it
came home to me that I, a golfer, a citizen,
a voter, was taking no part in the
great political struggle of the day. I
had not even declined to deal with my
butcher because he was a Conservative,
or closed my wife's draper's account
because he was a Liberal. It is a curious
fact, worthy the serious attention
of political philosophers, that butchers
are always Conservative and drapers
always Liberal.</p>

<p>I reached the club-house, and the first
man I saw was Redford. Now Redford
is a scratch player and a vice-president
of a Liberal Association. He has a
portrait of <span class="sc">Lloyd George</span> in his dining-room.</p>

<p>"Play you a round, old man, and give
you ten," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>I had to do something for my country.
"Never," I replied sternly. "I do not
play with homicides."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" asked
Redford, who is an estate agent when
he isn't golfing.</p>

<p>"I merely say," I replied, "that I
will play with no man who deliberately
connives at the slaughter of his fellow-citizens.
Every Liberal vote is a vote
for civil war."</p>

<p>"Man, this is a golf links, not Hyde
Park."</p>

<p>"I regret the course I have to take,
but my conscience is imperative. Away!
your clubs are blood-stained."</p>

<p>Redford shrugged his shoulders and
went off to get the professional to go
round with him.</p>

<p>The next man to drop in was Pobson.
He is a Grand Knight Imperial (or
something similar) of the Primrose
League, and makes speeches between
the ventriloquist and the step-dancer at
their meetings. He has signed the
Covenant, and reads every column
Mr. <span class="sc">Garvin</span> writes. In fact, I attribute
it entirely to Mr. <span class="sc">Garvin's</span> effect
on the nerves that his handicap has
been increased from plus two to
scratch.</p>

<p>"Want a round? Give you eight
strokes," he began.</p>

<p>"No, Sir; not with a man, who tampers
with the Army."</p>

<p>"You're either mad," said Pobson,
"or else you've been reading <i>The Daily
News</i>."</p>

<p>I will say this for Pobson&mdash;he seemed
inclined to believe in my madness as the
more credible alternative.</p>

<p>"Enough of this. Do you think I will
be seen playing with a man who ruins
our noble Army to gratify petty political
spite? Every Conservative vote means
an Army mutineer."</p>

<p>"Mad," said Pobson, still charitable,
as he left me.</p>

<p>Then there entered a dear old stranger
and my heart opened to him at once.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you're waiting
for a game, Sir," he began.</p>

<p>"Certainly," I said. "I'm an awfully
rotten player. Ashamed to mention my
handicap."</p>

<p>"Can't be worse than I am, Sir.
There'll be a pair of us. What shall
we play for? I like to have something
on it."</p>

<p>"What you like," I replied. "Box
of balls if you wish."</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>And away we went. I beat him by
eight up and seven to play and was
marching triumphantly up to the club-house
when Redford intercepted me.</p>

<p>"What's your game?" he said. "You
wouldn't play with me and now you've
played a round with our Candidate."</p>

<p>"Redford," I said, "when that dear
old gentleman came along I felt that I
had acted improperly in introducing
political acerbity on the links. I was
wrong, and as a proof of it I am willing
to play level with any politician in the
club for the same stakes&mdash;providing that
his handicap is over twenty."</p>

<h2>CAUTIOUS CONCLUSIONS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Westministering Angel.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>["Looking back at what has been achieved,
we can gain fresh courage for the perplexities
of the moment, in the sure and certain hope
that with energy and goodwill the task of
social amelioration will be safely accomplished,
if never finished."</p>

<p><i>"Westminster-Gazette" leading article.</i>]</p></blockquote>

<p>While then we admit that President
<span class="sc">Wilson's</span> technical violation of his
policy of non-intervention is fraught
with possibilities of difficulty if not of
actual danger for the United States, we
can at least fortify ourselves with the
reassuring consolation that, where
righteous intentions are backed by a
strong arm, the odds are generally in
favour of their prevailing, even though
they may never be victorious.</p>

<p>The prospects of a pacific solution
of the Ulster problem, though they
have not visibly improved in the last
week, at least cannot be said to have
substantially altered for the worse.
But the atmosphere, though no longer
electric, is not yet unclouded. All that
can be safely said is that, if only the
Government continue to play the game with
the same forbearance, tenacity,
and transparent honesty that they have
shown in the past, the gulf that yawns
between the extremists on either side
must one day be filled up, though never<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span>
bridged.</p>




<p>As we reflect on the happenings of
the last year, we cannot but be sensible
of a salutary <i>d&eacute;tente</i> in the relations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg 304]</span>Germany and Great Britain. That
this should lead to a closer understanding,
and ultimately to an alliance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>between the two Powers must be the
heartfelt prayer of every patriotic
Liberal. But good wishes are seldom
operative unless they are backed by
action. It is the duty of every lover of
his country to labour unremittingly to
promote this object, and at the same
time to resign himself to the conviction
that he may not live to see his
aim realised, though his descendants
may witness its translation into actuality,
even if its consummation is
indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>The vagaries of feminine fashion
are undoubtedly a source of misgiving
and disquietude to those, like ourselves,
who favour the extension of civil rights
to women. But, amid all the evidences
of frivolity and extravagance
which pain the judicious, we need
never relinquish the hope that, once the
pendulum swings backwards into the
direction of sanity, its retrogression
will probably be beneficial, even though
we cannot pronounce it satisfactory.</p>

<p>He got in at Peterborough; I spotted
him at once by the way he talked to the
porter.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily and looked round
the carriage for victims. I was doomed.
The only other passenger in it had been
asleep since Grantham.</p>

<p>I snatched up my paper and buried
my head in it and shut my eyes. Ten
seconds elapsed.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said gruffly.</p>

<p>"But your paper's upside down."</p>

<p>"Yes. I always read papers upside
down. I'm ambidextrous."</p>

<p>Ten seconds more silence.</p>

<p>"What do you think of this weather
we're having?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," I said curtly. I gave up
the paper in despair and looked hard
out of the window. I knew the man
was staring at me and compassing a
new attack.</p>

<p>He leant over at last.</p>

<p>"Now, what are your views on
Ulster?"</p>

<p>I couldn't say "Nothing" again; but,
even so, I retained some presence of
mind.</p>

<p>"I am a convinced Home Ruler, and
I never argue," I snapped.</p>

<p>"I happen to have gone into the
question pretty thoroughly," he began.</p>

<p>About ten minutes later he stopped
talking and looked at me triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Now, what answer have you to
that?" he said.</p>

<p>"None," I admitted.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span><h2>THE SLUGGARD.</h2>

<p>My Uncle James, whose memoirs I
am now preparing for publication, was
a many-sided man; but his chief
characteristic, I am inclined to think,
was the indomitable resolution with
which, disregarding hints, entreaties
and even direct abuse, he would lie in
bed of a morning. I have seen the
domestic staff of his hostess day after
day man&oelig;uvring restlessly in the passage
outside his room, doing all those
things which women do who wish to
rout a man out of bed without moving
Uncle James an inch. Footsteps might
patter outside his door; voices might
call one to the other; knuckles might rap
the panels; relays of shaving-water
might be dumped on his wash-stand;
but devil a bit would Uncle James
budge, till finally the enemy,
giving in, would bring him
his breakfast in bed. Then,
after a leisurely cigar, he
would at last rise and, having
dressed himself with care,
come downstairs and be the
ray of sunshine about the
home.</p>

<p>For many years I was
accustomed to look on Uncle
James as a mere sluggard.
I pictured ants raising their
antenn&aelig; scornfully at the
sight of him. I was to learn
that not sloth but a deep purpose
dictated his movements,
or his lack of movement.</p>

<p>"My boy," said Uncle
James, "more evil is wrought
by early rising than by want
of thought. Happy homes
are broken up by it. Why do men
leave charming wives and run away
with quite unattractive adventuresses?
Because good women always get up
early. Bad women, on the other hand,
invariably rise late. To prize a man
out of bed at some absurd hour like
nine-thirty is to court disaster. To
take my own case, when I first wake
in the morning my mind is one welter
of unkindly thoughts. I think of all
the men who owe me money, and hate
them. I review the regiment of women
who have refused to marry me, and
loathe them. I meditate on my faithful
dog, Ponto, and wish that I had kicked
him overnight. To introduce me to
the human race at that moment would
be to let loose a scourge upon society.
But what a difference after I have lain
in bed looking at the ceiling for an
hour or so. The milk of human kindness
comes surging back into me like a
tidal wave. I love my species. Give
me a bit of breakfast then, and let me
enjoy a quiet meditative smoke, and I
am a pleasure to all with whom I come
in contact."</p>

<p>He settled himself more comfortably
upon the pillows and listened luxuriously
for a moment to the sound of rushing
housemaids in the passage.</p>

<p>"Late rising saved my life once," he
said. "Pass me my tobacco pouch."</p>

<p>He lit his pipe and expelled a cloud
of smoke.</p>

<p>"It was when I was in South
America. There was the usual revolution
in the Republic which I had
visited in my search for concessions,
and, after due consideration, I threw in
my lot with the revolutionary party.
It is usually a sound move, for on
these occasions the revolutionists have
generally corrupted the standing army,
and they win before the other side has
time to re-corrupt it at a higher figure.
In South America, thrice armed is he
who has his quarrel just, but six times
he who gets his bribe in fust. On the
occasion of which I speak, however, a
hitch was caused by the fact of another
party revolting against the revolutionists
while they were revolting against the
revolutionary party which had just
upset the existing Government. Everything
is very complicated in those
parts. You will remember that the
Tango came from there.</p>

<p>"Well, the long and the short of it
was that I was captured and condemned
to be shot. I need not go into my
emotions at the time. Suffice it to say
that I was led out and placed with my
back against an adobe wall. The
firing-party raised their rifles.</p>

<p>"It was a glorious morning. The sun
was high in a cloudless sky. Everywhere
sounded the gay rattle of the
rattle-snake and the mellow chirrup of
the hydrophobia-skunk and the gila
monster. It vexed me to think that I
was so soon to leave so peaceful a scene.</p>

<p>"And then suddenly it flashed upon
me that there had been a serious
mistake.</p>

<p>"'Wait!' I called.</p>

<p>"'What's the matter now?' asked
the leader of the firing squad.</p>

<p>"'Matter?' I said. 'Look at the
sun. The court-martial distinctly said
that I was to be shot at sunrise. Do
you call this sunrise? It must be
nearly lunch-time.'</p>

<p>"'It's not our fault,' said the firing-party.
'We came to your cell all
right, but you wouldn't get up. You
told us to leave it on the mat.'</p>

<p>"I did remember then having heard
someone fussing about outside my cell
door.</p>

<p>"'That's neither here nor there,' I
said firmly. 'It was your business to
shoot me at sunrise, and you haven't
done it. I claim a re-trial on
a technicality.'</p>

<p>"Well, they stormed and
blustered, but I was adamant;
and in the end they had to
take me back to my cell to be
tried again. I was condemned
to be shot at sunrise next
morning, and they went to
the trouble of giving me an
alarm clock and setting it for
3 <span class="sc">a.m.</span></p>

<p>"But at about eleven
o'clock that night there was
another revolution. Some
revolutionaries revolted
against the revolutionaries
who had revolted against the
revolutionaries who had revolted
against the Government,
and, having re-re-corrupted
the standing army,
they swept all before them, and at
about midnight I was set free. I recall
that the new President kissed me
on both cheeks and called me the
saviour of his country. Poor fellow,
there was another revolution next day,
and, being a confirmed early riser, he
got up in time to be shot at sunrise."</p>

<p>Uncle James sighed, possibly with
regret, but more probably with happiness,
for at this moment they brought
in his breakfast.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By our Special Parasitic Penman.</i>)</p>

<p><i>How I Got There and Back</i> is the title
of a new story of adventurous exploration
which Messrs. Jones, Younger
announce for immediate publication.
The author, Mr. J. Minch Howson,
whose text has been revised by the
publishers, has had some astonishing
experiences as a bonzo-hunter in the
Aruwhimi forest. On one occasion he
was rescued by a mad elephant from
the jaws of an okapi, into which he
had inadvertently fallen while flying
from a gorilla. During his residence
among the pygmies Mr. Howson became
such an adept with the long blow-pipe
that they offered him the headship of
the tribe; but, as this involved the
adoption of anthropophagous habits,
he was reluctantly obliged to decline
the honour.</p>

<p>Mr. Bamborough, the famous violinist,
who recently changed his name
by deed poll from Bamberger, has
compiled a further volume of reminiscences
based on his experiences as a
travelling <i>virtuoso</i> in all four hemispheres.
Some of these have already
been made public in the Press, but in a
condensed form. He now tells us for
the first time in full detail his astounding
adventures in New Guinea, where
he was captured and partially eaten by
cannibals, and his awful ordeal in the
Never-Never Land, when he was attacked
simultaneously by an emu and
a wallaby, and conquered them both
by the strains of his violin. The
volume, which will be published by
the House of Pougher and Kleimer,
is profusely illustrated with portraits
of Mr. Bamborough at various stages
of his career, before and after the
execution of the deed poll; of Mrs.
Bamborough and their three gifted
children, Wotan, Salome and Isolde
Bamborough; and of her father, Sir
Pompey Boldero, F.R.G.S., formerly
Attorney-General of Pitcairn Island.
It is further enriched with a number of
letters in <i>fac-simile</i> from the Begum of
<span class="sc">Bhopal</span>, General <span class="sc">Huerta</span>, the <span class="sc">Lord
Chief Justice</span>, Madame <span class="sc">Humbert</span>,
Mr. <span class="sc">Jerome K. Jerome</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Clement
Shorter</span>, Mrs. <span class="sc">Alec Tweedie</span> and
the late <span class="sc">King Theebaw</span> of Burmah.</p>

<p>Messrs. Vigo announce the speedy
publication of a volume of reminiscences
from the pen of Count Lio Rotsac, the
famous Bohemian revolutionary. In it
special interest attaches to the long and
desperate struggle between the Count
and his rival, Baron Aracsac, which
ended in the supersession of the latter
and his confinement in the gloomy
fortress prison of Niola Stelbat.</p>

<p>Miss Poppy McLurkin, the composer
of that delightful song <i>Peter Popinjay</i>,
of which over a quarter of a million
copies have been sold or given away,
has expanded the four verses of her
lyric into a full-length novel, which
Messrs. Gulliver will publish under the
same title. Miss McLurkin, who is
still on the sunny side of thirty, is
one of the few female performers on
the bagpipes in the literary profession.</p>

<p>New novelists are always welcome
if only for the titles of their books, for,
after all, perusal of their contents is not
compulsory. In this category may be
included <i>Telepathic Theodora</i>, by Beryl
Smuts; <i>The Rottenest Story in the
World</i>, by Dermot Stuggy; and <i>In the
Doldrums</i>, by Wally Gogg.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg 308]</span><h2>THE OBVIOUS.</h2>

<p>Celia had been calling on a newly-married
friend of hers. They had been
school-girls together; they had looked
over the same Algebra book (or whatever
it was that Celia learnt at school&mdash;I
have never been quite certain);
they had done their calisthenics side by
side; they had compared picture-postcards
of <span class="sc">Lewis Waller</span>. Ah me! the
fairy princes they had imagined together
in those days ... and here am
I, and somewhere in the City (I believe
he is a stockbroker) is Ermyntrude's
husband, and we play our golf on
Saturday afternoons, and complain of
our dinners, and&mdash;&mdash; Well, anyhow,
they were both married, and Celia had
been calling on Ermyntrude.</p>

<p>"I hope you did all the right things,"
I said. "Asked to see the wedding-ring,
and admired the charming little
house, and gave a few hints on the
proper way to manage a husband."</p>

<p>"Rather," said Celia. "But it did
seem funny, because she used to be
older than me at school."</p>

<p>"Isn't she still?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>no</i>! I'm ever so much older
now.... Talking about wedding-rings,"
she went on, as she twisted her
own round and round, "she's got all
sorts of things written inside hers&mdash;the
date and their initials and I don't
know what else."</p>

<p>"There can't be much else&mdash;unless
perhaps she has a very large finger."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven't got <i>anything</i> in
mine," said Celia mournfully. She took
off the offending ring and gave it to me.</p>

<p>On the day when I first put the ring
on her finger, Celia swore an oath that
nothing but death, extreme poverty or
brigands should ever remove it. I swore
too. Unfortunately it fell off in the
course of the afternoon, which seemed
to break the spell somehow. So now
it goes off and on just like any other
ring. I took it from her and looked
inside.</p>

<p>"There are all sorts of things here
too," I said. "Really, you don't seem
to have read your wedding-ring at all.
Or, anyhow, you've been skipping."</p>

<p>"There's nothing," said Celia in the
same mournful voice. "I do think you
might have put something,"'</p>

<p>I went and sat on the arm of her
chair and held the ring up.</p>

<p>"You're an ungrateful wife," I said,
"after all the trouble I took. Now
look there," and I pointed with a pencil,
"what's the first thing you see?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-two. That's only the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was your age when you
married me. I had it put in at enormous
expense. If you had been eighteen,
the man said, or&mdash;or nine, it would
have come much cheaper. But no, I
would have your exact age. You were
twenty-two, and that's what I had
engraved on it. Very well. Now what
do you see next to it?"</p>

<p>"A crown."</p>

<p>"Yes. And what does that mean?
In the language of&mdash;er&mdash;crowns it
means 'You are my queen.' I insisted
on a crown. It would have been
cheaper to have had a lion, which
means&mdash;er&mdash;lions, but I was determined
not to spare myself. For I thought," I
went on pathetically, "I quite thought
you would like a crown."</p>

<p>"Oh, I do," cried Celia quickly, "if
it really means that." She took the
ring in her hands and looked at it
lovingly. "And what's that there?
Sort of a man's head."</p>

<p>I gazed at her sadly.</p>

<p>"You don't recognize it? Has a
year of marriage so greatly changed
me? Celia, it is your Ronald! I sat
for that, hour after hour, day after;
day, for your sake, Celia. It is not a
perfect likeness; in the small space
allotted to him the sculptor has hardly
done me justice. But it is your
Ronald.... And there," I added,
"is his initial 'r.' Oh, woman, the
amount of thought I spent on that
ring!"</p>

<p>She came a little closer and slipped
the ring on my finger.</p>

<p>"Spend a little more," she pleaded.
"There's plenty of room. Just have
something nice written in it&mdash;something
about you and me."</p>

<p>"Like 'Pisgah'?"</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Perhaps it's
'Mizpah,' or 'Ichabod,' or 'Habakkuk.'
I'm sure there's a word you put on
rings&mdash;I expect they'd know at the
shop."</p>

<p>"But I don't want what they know
at shops. It must be something quite
private and special."</p>

<p>"But the shop has got to know about
it when I tell them. And I don't like
telling strange men in shops private
and special things about ourselves. I
love you, Celia, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That would be a lovely thing," she
said, clasping her hands eagerly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"'I love you, Celia.'"</p>

<p>I looked at her aghast.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to order that in
cold blood from the shopman?"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't mind. Besides, if he
saw us together he'd probably know.
You aren't afraid of a goldsmith, are
you?"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of any goldsmith
living&mdash;or goldfish either, if it comes
to that. But I should prefer to be
sentimental in some other language
than plain English. I could order
'<i>Cara sposa</i>', or&mdash;or '<i>Spaghetti</i>,' or
anything like that, without a tremor."</p>

<p>"But of course you shall put just
whatever you like. Only&mdash;only let it
be original. Not Mizpahs."</p>

<p>"Right," I said.</p>

<p>For three days I wandered past gold-and-silversmiths
with the ring in my
pocket ... and for three days Celia
went about without a wedding-ring,
and, for all I know, without even her
marriage-lines in her muff. And on the
fourth day I walked boldly in.</p>

<p>"I want," I said, "a wedding-ring
engraved," and I felt in my pockets.
"Not initials," I said, and I felt in some
more pockets, "but&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" I tried
the trousers pockets again. "Well,
look here, I'll be quite frank with you.
I&mdash;er&mdash;want&mdash;&mdash;" I fumbled in my
ticket-pocket, "I want 'I love you' on
it," and I went through the waistcoat
pockets a third time. "I&mdash;er&mdash;love
you."</p>

<p>"Me?" said the shopman, surprised.</p>

<p>"I love you," I repeated mechanically.
"I love you, I love you, I&mdash;&mdash; Well,
look here, perhaps I'd better go
back and get the ring."</p>

<p>On the next day I was there again;
but there was a different man behind
the counter.</p>

<p>"I want this ring engraved," I said.</p>

<p>"Certainly. What shall we put?"</p>

<p>I had felt the question coming. I
had a sort of instinct that he would
ask me that. But I couldn't get the
words out again.</p>

<p>"Well," I hesitated, "I&mdash;er&mdash;well."</p>

<p>"Ladies often like the date put in.
When is it to be?"</p>

<p>"When is what to be?"</p>

<p>"The wedding," he smiled.</p>

<p>"It has been," I said. "It's all
over. You're too late for it."</p>

<p>I gave myself up to thought. At all
costs I must be original. There must
be something on Celia's wedding-ring
that had never been on any other's....</p>

<p>There was only one thing I could
think of.</p>

<hr />

<p>The engraved ring arrived as we were
at tea a few days later, and I had a
sudden overwhelming fear that Celia
would not be pleased. I saw that I
must explain it to her. After all, there
was a distinguished precedent.</p>

<p>"Come into the bath-room a moment,"
I said, and I led the way.</p>

<p>She followed, wondering.</p>

<p>"What is that?" I asked, pointing
to a blue thing on the floor.</p>

<p>"The bath-mat," she said, surprised.</p>

<p>"And what is written on it?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;'bath-mat,' of course."</p>

<p>"Of course," I said ... and I handed
her the wedding-ring.</p>

<h2>THE SITTER SAT UPON.</h2>

<p>Wilkinson is a sculptor. I don't
mean that he lives by sculping. No.
As he puts it himself: "My lower self,
the self that wants bread and meat and
warmth and shelter, lives on unearned
increment. My higher self, the only
self that counts, lives on Art."</p>

<p>Wilkinson and I had been sworn
pals from our boyhood till the day he
said: "By the way, old thing, I've
never had a turn at <i>your</i> headpiece.
You might give me a few sittings."</p>

<p>For the first time I found myself
seated on a sitter's throne, while
Wilkinson stood at his modelling stand
working away at a mass of clay that
faintly suggested a human head and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Need you yawn so often?" There
was a hint of savagery in Wilkinson's
tone that was new to me.</p>

<p>"Why, you're not doing my mouth
yet," I urged.</p>

<p>"No, but when a mouth like yours
opens wide it alters the shape of the
whole skull."</p>

<p>I was astonished and hurt, and took
refuge in dignified silence.</p>

<p>"Shall you send it&mdash;I mean me&mdash;to
the Academy?" I asked by-and-by.</p>

<p>"Depends on how it pans out,"
grunted Wilkinson, leaving the clay,
twirling the movable throne round, and
taking a frowning survey of me in
various aspects. "I might send it in
with Popplewell's bust, as a sort of
make-weight."</p>

<p>"As a sort of make-weight!" I
echoed indignantly; and then, more
calmly, "Popplewell's finished, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;gone to be cast; and then
comes the marble."</p>

<p>"Oh, Popplewell's to be done in
marble, is he? What shall <i>I</i> be done
in?"</p>

<p>Wilkinson was taking an upward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>view of my features now, with a look
of extreme distaste on his countenance.</p>

<p>"You? Oh, if I decide to finish you,
it'll be just the clay-burnt terra-cotta,
you know. Tut, tut, tut!"</p>

<p>"Why tut, tut, tut?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No offence, old chap, but you <i>have</i>
such queer facial bones;" and as he
turned back to his modelling I heard
him mutter: "You never really know
what people are like till they sit to
you."</p>

<p>Again I felt a bit hurt, and this time
I indulged a retort. "Wonder if you'll
get Popplewell into the Academy.
You've never had anything in yet,
have you?"</p>

<p>"We sculptors are so vilely handicapped
by the wretched amount of
space the Academy people give us!"
said Wilkinson angrily. "Still, I've
great hopes this time. Not only is
my work improved, but it's a popular
subject&mdash;Popplewell, the novelist.
There&mdash;that'll do for to-day. I've
got the construction all right," looking
resentfully from the clay head to mine,
"though no one would believe it who
hadn't your head here to compare it
with."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with my
head?" I asked irritably as I got
gingerly off the movable throne. "And,
anyhow, I didn't ask to be modelled.
You made me sit here&mdash;I didn't want
to do it."</p>

<p>"Oh, people make practice for one,
whatever they're like."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," I said stiffly.</p>

<p>At the second sitting I tried to make
allowances for the artistic temperament
when Wilkinson prowled round me with
a look of something like horror on his
face, assaulted my features with compasses,
and turned away gibbering. I
even kept calm when informed that one
of my eyes was considerably larger and
wider open than the other and that I
had "no drawing" in my face. "No
offence, old chap," added my former
friend with a grin. "You must remember
it's the artist-eye that's responsible
for these cursory reflections."</p>

<p>"I wonder," I remarked musingly,
"whether the artist-eye is a feature that
occasionally gets blacked by an indignant
sitter."</p>

<p>At the third and fourth sittings more
bitter so-called truths were handed out
to me, and he was down on my "construction"
like a hundred of bricks.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i>'s a normal one," here he indicated
a skull on a shelf; "<i>his</i> bones
are all right. But if yours were stripped
of the flesh&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shan't be sorry when these sittings
are over," I said; then, as I caught a
side view of the clay head, "I <i>say</i>! Am
I as frightful as that?"</p>

<p>"As frightful as that!" snorted Wilkinson;
"why, I've <i>flattered</i> you, if
anything. People never know what
they're like. There's such a lot of
rotten vanity knocking about."</p>

<p>When the last sitting was over my
wrongs found voice.</p>

<p>"When I first sat to you," I said in
a tense tone, "I was comparatively
happy; my self-esteem was in a healthy
state; I felt that I was well-looking at
my best, even good-looking. I go from
you to-day a broken man, my confidence
shaken, my manners spoiled by
the consciousness that my construction
is wrong, that there is 'no drawing' in
my face, and that neither my eyes nor
my nostrils are a pair; and, not content
with this, you have darkened my
remote future by implying that when it
is time for me to be merely a skull I shall
be an absurd one. May Heaven forgive
you, Wilkinson&mdash;<i>I</i> never can!"</p>

<p>For some weeks we stood apart, "like
cliffs that had been rent asunder," and
then one day Wilkinson came up and
thumped me on the back. "It's always
the unexpected that happens, old thing,"
he said. "Popplewell's bust was rejected
at once, but yours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Am I <i>in</i>?" In my excitement I
forgot my wrongs.</p>

<p>"No, not <i>in</i>; but you were a <i>doubtful</i>.
Only think&mdash;first doubtful I've ever
had! To have a doubtful sculpture is
as good as having two or three paintings
on the line. You can't be such a bad
subject after all. I'll have another touch
at you, and next year see if you're not
in! Come and have some lunch."</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc">Extracted from the Diary
of Toby, M.P.</span>)</p>

<p><i>House of Commons, Tuesday,
April 14.</i>&mdash;Back to
grindstone after so-called
Easter recess. Divisions
reveal presence of aggregate
of something less than 200
Members. Watchful Whip,
ever suspicious of ambush,
succeeded in mustering four-fifths
of the whole. Ministerial
majority maintained
at average of six-score.</p>

<p>Increased by a unit consequent
on return of <span class="sc">Premier</span>
after re-election by
faithful Fife. Towards close of Questions
was discovered standing at Bar
awaiting <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> call.</p>

<p>"Members desiring to take their
seats will please come to the Table."</p>

<p>As he advanced, escorted by <span class="sc">Chief
Whip</span> and Scottish colleague, Liberals
and Irish Nationalists leaped to their
feet, waving hats and handkerchiefs
in loyal greeting. Only the haughty
Labour Member remained seated.
Not for him to pay court to chiefs
of other parties, howsoever
friendly. He is there as representative
of the Working Man;
is neither to be bought nor sold,
cowed nor cajoled.</p>

<p>A fine spectacle. Pity Strangers'
Galleries almost empty.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/313-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/313-1.png" alt="" /></a><h3>THE NEW MEMBER.</h3>

<p><i>Mr. <span class="sc">Speaker</span>.</i> "Pleased to make your acquaintance, Sir. Somehow
I seem to know your face."</p></div>

<p>In process of swearing-in new
Member nothing taken for granted.
<span class="sc">Halsbury</span> discovered this when,
far back in the last century, he,
known at the time as <span class="sc">Hardinge
Giffard</span>, came up to take his
seat for Launceston. Challenged
by the Clerk for production of
writ of return, made painful discovery
that it was not at hand.
Sure he put it in his pocket when
he left home; but which pocket?</p>

<p>In full gaze of four hundred
quizzical Members he proceeded
to search. Was there ever mortal
man with so many pockets stuffed
with such miscellaneous contents
as <span class="sc">Disraeli's</span> Solicitor-General
littered the Table withal? In the
end&mdash;and its coming seemed interminable&mdash;the
desired document
was found coyly hidden in his
hat left on the seat he had
occupied under the Gallery awaiting
summons to the Table.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>, cool and
businesslike as usual, had necessary
document ready. Handing
it to the Clerk, he once more
signed the roll of Parliament.</p>

<p>Then came critical moment, awaited
with keen interest by House. The
roll signed, it is duty of Clerk to
conduct new Member to <span class="sc">Speaker</span> and
introduce him by name.</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="sc">Asquith</span>!" the Clerk announced.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/313-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/313-2.png" alt="" /></a><h3>THE GREAT EAST AFRICAN PROTECTOR.</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

</div> <div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">(Mr. <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>.)</p>
</div> </div> </div>

<p>With half start of surprise <span class="sc">Speaker</span>
regarded newcomer; thought he recognised
him as he stood at the Table.
All doubt now removed.
Yes, it was <span class="sc">Asquith</span>. With
genial smile and friendly
grip of the hand he welcomed
the new Member.
Delighted Ministerialists
cheered again at this happy
conclusion of the episode.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Committee
stage of Bill pledging
national credit for loan to
East African Protectorates
entered upon. Not without
opposition from Ministerial
benches. <span class="sc">Alpheus Cleophas
Morton</span>, of whom we
hear little in these degenerate
days, insisted that
this kind of charity should
begin at home&mdash;that is in
the Highlands of Scotland. <span class="sc">Wedgwood</span>
and <span class="sc">Thorne</span> thought Government
had gone far enough in the way of
lavish expenditure of tax-payers' money
by providing them and others with
salaries of &pound;400 a year. From other
side of House <span class="sc">Banbury</span> made several
speeches in succession. Division called
and opposition swamped.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;"Such larks!" as <i>Joe
Gargery</i> used to say to <i>Pip</i> when
they met for confidential confabulation.
Of all men it was <span class="sc">Cousin
Hugh</span> began them. At first sight
difficult to associate tendency to
larkiness with austerity of Member
for Oxford University. But
human nature is complex, and,
after all, <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh</span> is only
human.</p>

<p>In a former Parliament he was
convicted of what was officially
known as loitering in the Lobby.
It was a Wednesday afternoon,
and in those days debate automatically
stood adjourned at half-past
five. Business to the fore
related to Marriage with a
Deceased Wife's Sister. Every
prospect of Resolution being approved
if there were opportunity
for division. The thing to do
was to prevent one taking place.
Accordingly, when House divided
on Closure motion, <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh</span>
and his confederates were such an
unconscionably long time returning
to their places that half-past
five struck before main question
could be put from Chair. Debate
accordingly stood adjourned for
indefinite period.</p>

<p>A fortnight ago another of
those domestic questions which
stir <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh's</span> soul to the
depths came up. At the ballot-box
a Member secured favourable
position for motion relating
to Divorce. <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>straightway blocked it by a bogus Bill.
Last Wednesday Opposition proposed
on motion for adjournment for Easter
to attack Government from divers
points of compass. Ministerialists,
taking leaf out of <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh's</span>
book, put down notices that blocked the
whole lot. To-day <span class="sc">Premier's</span> attention
called to the matter. Admits "situation
is scandalous"; undertakes forthwith
to submit Resolution dealing with
it.</p>

<p>Characteristically odd feature in case is
that it was <span class="sc">Brother Bob</span> who brought
matters to a head by tabling a Resolution
making impossible in future the
vagaries of <span class="sc">Cousin Hugh</span>.</p>

<p>Which shows afresh how remarkable
are the resources of a
family rooted in the spacious times
of <span class="sc">Queen Elizabeth</span>.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Criminal Justice
Administration Bill read a
second time.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;As at approach of
Spring the time of the singing of
birds comes, and the voice of the
turtle is heard in the land, so
thus early in the session the
voice of the objector is heard in
the House of Commons. On
days when Private Bills come up
for consideration, there is a scene
which interests while it perplexes
occupants of Ladies' Gallery, in
whose full view it is set. As soon
as <span class="sc">Speaker</span> takes the Chair,
before galleries are open to male
strangers, there enters from hidden
staircase leading to gallery over
clock a procession of businesslike
gentlemen. Silently, swiftly, they
flood what is known as Distinguished
Strangers' Gallery.</p>

<p>Clerk at Table reads list of
Private Bills awaiting second
reading: (1) Middlesbrough Corporation
Bill, (2) Lurgan Gas
and Electricity Bill, (3) Northwich
Urban District Council Bill. From one
side or other of benches below Gangway
sounds a single word: "Object!"
Title of next Bill on list recited. Again
the cabalistic word, and so on to end of
catalogue. This reached, anonymous
Strangers in gallery rise and depart as
swiftly, as silently, as they came, and
what is still known as Question-hour
(though it is limited to forty-five
minutes) opens.</p>

<p>Whisper runs round Ladies' Gallery
that mysterious Strangers are detachment
of Ulster volunteers out on drill.
As a matter of fact they are solicitors
concerned for fate of private measures.
With extreme rarity is a Private Bill
debated on second reading. As a
rule that stage is formally conceded,
real work being done in select committees
upstairs. One of the archaic
absurdities of legislative practice remaining
in Commons is that a single
Member has autocratic power to delay
progress of particular Bills approaching
Committee stage by murmuring or
shouting a magic dissyllable.</p>

<p>Last Session <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span>, offended
at certain course taken by Board of
Trade in respect of Private Bill for
which he was concerned, held up for a
fortnight the whole course of private
legislation. At the end of that time
Government with a majority still a
hundred strong capitulated. It was an
exceptionally weary time for solicitors
filing in and filing out of the Gallery,
day by day passing and their Bill
"getting no forrarder."</p>

<p>Fortunately in these cases there are
two Bills that run concurrently. One
is the legislative measure to which a
Member objects; the other the bill of
costs in which these daily attendances
at the opening of successive sittings,
this mounting and descending of unsympathetic
stairways, are doubtless
duly noted.</p>

<h2>ONCE UPON A TIME.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Aviation.</span></p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little
primrose who grew all alone on a sunny
bank. All around her were primroses
in clusters, but she was a solitary
flower.</p>

<p>Having no brothers or sisters to talk
to and no very near neighbours, she
made a confidant of a bee, who would
often sit with her for several minutes at
a time. He was brusque and opinionated,
but he was wise too, and, having
wings, knew the world; and she never
tired of hearing of his travels.</p>

<p>He told her of gardens where
flowers of every kind and sweetness
bloomed. "Not like you,"
he said&mdash;"not wild flowers that
no one values, but choice, wonderful,
aristocratic flowers that
are picked out of catalogues and
cost money and need attention
from a gardener."</p>

<p>"What is a gardener?" the
primrose asked.</p>

<p>"A gardener is a man who
does nothing but look after
flowers," said the bee. "He brings
them water and picks off the dead
leaves, and all the time he is
thinking how to make them
more beautiful."</p>

<p>"How splendid!" said the
primrose.</p>

<p>And the bee told her of the
houses in these gardens, with
pleasant sunny rooms, and
pictures, and flowers in vases to
cheer the eyes of the rich people
who lived there.</p>

<p>"How splendid!" said the
primrose again. "I wish I could
see it all. I should love to be in
a vase in a beautiful room and be
admired by rich people."</p>

<p>"You're too simple," said the
bee. "You haven't a chance.  You've
got to stay where you are till you die."</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I have wings like
you?" said the primrose.</p>

<p>"How absurd!" replied the bee as he
flew away.</p>

<p>But the next day the primrose looked
up and saw a most wonderful thing.
A primrose that really had wings! A
flying primrose! A primrose that could
go anywhere just like the bee. It darted
hither and thither so gaily, alighting
where it wished and then soaring up
again right into the blue sky above the
earth.</p>

<p>The solitary primrose called to it, but
it did not hear, and was soon out of
sight.</p>

<p>"So primroses needn't always stop
where they are till they die," she said
to herself. "Why did the bee deceive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span>me? If I were like that I could see the
garden and the gardener and the pretty
gay sitting-rooms and the rich people."</p>

<p>She waited impatiently for the bee's
return, and when he came she told him
about the aviator.</p>

<p>"He was so splendid," she said, "so
big and strong, and he flew beautifully.
How can I get wings, too?"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the bee. "That wasn't
a primrose. That was a brimstone
butterfly; and as for flying&mdash;why, he
can't compare with me. I could beat
him every time: hundred yards, quarter-mile,
mile, long distance&mdash;everything."</p>

<p>"He looked just like a wonderful
big primrose," said the solitary flower
wistfully.</p>

<p>"That's because you've got only one
eye," said the bee. "He was a butterfly
right enough;" and he hurried away
laughing at the silliness of her mistake.</p>

<p>But that day the little primrose had
part of her wish; for a party of children
came into her corner of the wood and
began to pick the flowers with cries of
delight.</p>

<p>"Here's one all alone!" said a small
girl. "I shall pick that for mother."
Straightway the primrose was torn
from its root and held tightly in a hand
which was far too hot to be pleasant.</p>

<p>Down the road the children went, and
the primrose looked as well as she could
at the hedges and the trees.</p>

<p>"So this is the world," she said to
herself. "It seems really interesting,
but I should like it better if I didn't feel
so faint."</p>

<p>At last they came to a garden gate
and passed through it, up a long path,
with strange flowers on each side, which
the primrose saw mistily, for she was
now really ill.</p>

<p>"I am sure it is all very beautiful,"
she murmured, "but I know I shall
die if I don't have some water soon."</p>

<p>And then they entered a room, and
the little girl hurried up to a lady
and gave her the solitary primrose.
"It was growing all alone," she said,
"so I brought it for you."</p>

<p>"Put it into a vase at once," said
the mother, "or it will die." And the
primrose was placed in water, and at
once began to revive.</p>

<p>Then she looked about her and saw
what a nice room it was, and was
happy.</p>

<p>The next morning in came the bee
with a great fluster and bumped all
over the room.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he said to the little primrose,
"you here?"</p>

<p>She told him all her adventures.</p>

<p>"Well, what I said is right, isn't
it?" the bee remarked. "It's all very
jolly here, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but I wish I didn't
feel so weak. I never had an ache
when I was in the wood."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you weren't among the nobs
then," said the bee; "make the most
of your time while you're here, for it
won't be for long, you know."</p>

<p>"Come and see me to-morrow," the
little primrose whimpered. "I feel so
lonely here. I was happier in the
wood."</p>

<p>"You won't be alive to-morrow," said
the bee cheerily. "But never mind,
you have seen the world." And out he
bashed again, blowing his motor-horn
to clear the way.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg 316]</span><h2>AT THE PLAY.</h2>

<p class="center">"<span class="sc">Pygmalion.</span>"</p>

<p>The original Pygmalion took a block
of dead ivory and made of it so fair
a figure of a woman that he fell in love
with his own creation, and Aphrodite,
at his request, brought it to life.
Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw's</span> <i>Pygmalion</i> takes
a live flower-girl, turns her
into a lifeless wax figure fit
for a milliner's shop-window,
and flatters himself, as an
artist, on the result, but,
as a man, proposes to take
no interest in it, moral or
physical. So you can easily
see why almost any other
proper name you can think
of would have done better
for the title.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/316-1.png"><img width="100%" src="images/316-1.png" alt="" /></a><p>We venture to suggest a new attitude to illustrate the ease of
manner which one expects from a Master of Phonetics and Deportment.</p>

<p><i>Henry Higgins</i> <span class="wider">Sir <span class="sc">Herbert Tree</span>.</span></p></div>

<p>The play itself shows the
same typical inconsequence,
the same freedom from the
pedantry of logic. <i>Eliza
Doolittle's</i> ambition is to become
fitted for the functions
of a young lady in a florist's
shop. <i>Henry Higgins</i>, professor
of phonetics, undertakes for a
wager to teach her the manners and
diction of a duchess&mdash;a smaller achievement,
of course, in Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw's</span> eyes,
but still a step in the right direction.
And he is better than his word. After
six months she has acquired a mincing
speech, from which she is still liable to
lapse into appalling indiscretions; but
after another six months the product
might pass muster in any <i>modiste's</i>
showroom. And then she turns
on him and protests that he has
spoilt her life. As a flower-girl,
she tells him, she used to earn
her living honestly; now there
is nothing she is good for.</p>

<p>Of course, you say, her contact
with refined society&mdash;"we needs
must love the highest when we
see it"&mdash;has unfitted her for
mixing with inferior people. On
the contrary. She has, it is
true, passed the final test of a
series of social functions; but
meanwhile all this time of her
apprenticeship in manners she
has been living her daily life,
doing half-menial duties, in the
house of <i>Higgins</i>, who happens
to have no manners at all. One
trembles, indeed, to picture the
figure that he himself, the master,
must have cut when he took
his pupil to the halls of the great.</p>

<p>Then perhaps, you say, she has
fallen into an unrequited passion
for him, and this accounts for her
peevishness? Well, if she has,
we have only Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw's</span> word
for it, and she gets no sympathy from us
for her deplorable taste in men. There
was another man who was always about
the house, a man with a habit of courtesy,
but this gallant soldier left her cold.
Such is the perversity of women&mdash;and
Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw</span>. <i>Higgins's</i> one act of civility
to his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</i>, on which we had to
base our hopes of a happy issue, was to
throw a bunch of flowers at her from
a balcony in Chelsea&mdash;not perhaps a
very tactful reminder of her origin.
But he was only just in time. Another
two seconds of delay and the final
curtain would have cut off this tardy
and inadequate effort of conciliation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/316-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/316-2.png" alt="" /></a><h3>FROM FLOWER-GIRL TO PERFECT LADY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Showing middle stage in course of lessons in Polite
Conversation.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Eliza Doolittle</i> (Mrs. <span class="sc">Patrick Campbell</span>) to <i>Mrs. Eynsford-Hill</i>
(Miss <span class="sc">Carlotta Addison</span>). "An aunt of mine
died of in-flu-en-za: but it's my be-lief they done h-her in."</p></div>

<p>However, nobody goes to a production
of Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw's</span> with the idea of seeing
a play. We go to hear him discourse
on just anything that occurs to him
without prejudice in the matter of his
mouthpiece. This time he was represented
by a dustman; and for once Mr.
<span class="sc">Shaw</span> consented to temper his wisdom
to the limitations of its repository.
His <i>Alfred Doolittle</i> (father of the
flower-girl) threw off a little cheap
satire on the morality of the
middle-classes, yet admitted
the drawbacks of unauthorised
union (as practised by
himself), since a man's wife
is there to be kicked, whereas
a mistress is apt to be more
exigent of the amenities; you
must adopt a more lover-like
attitude if you want to retain
her. He also argued brightly
in defence of his proposal to
sell his own daughter to any
man for a fiver; let fall a
platitude or two in praise of
the lot of the undeserving
poor; and (having come in for
a fortune) found that charity
had lost its blessedness&mdash;that
the touch of nature which
makes the whole world kin
was only admirable when you did the
"touching" yourself. Not bad for a
dustman, but Mr. <span class="sc">Shaw</span> has done better.</p>

<p>For the rest the attraction lay in the
performance of individual actors rather
than in the stuff of the play. Mrs.
<span class="sc">Patrick Campbell</span> was delicious,
both in her unregenerate state, and
even more during the middle phase of
the refining process. She made the
Third Act a pure delight. Later, when
she became tragic, she sacrificed
something of her particular charm
to the author's insincerity.</p>

<p>Sir <span class="sc">Herbert Tree</span>, always at
his best in comedy, was an excellent
<i>Higgins</i> in his lighter
moods. As for Mr. <span class="sc">Edmund
Gurney</span>, he was far the best
dustman I have ever met. His
freedom from scruples, combined
with a natural gift for unctuous
and persuasive rhetoric, commanded
admiration. <i>Higgins</i>,
indeed, who could read potentialities
at a glance, considered
that he might, under happier
conditions, have gone far toward
attaining Cabinet rank or filling
a Welsh pulpit.</p>

<p>Of the others, Mr. <span class="sc">Philip
Merivale</span> played the too subsidiary
part of <i>Colonel Pickering</i>
with admirable self-repression;
and Miss <span class="sc">Rosamond Mayne-Young</span>,
as the mother of <i>Higgins</i>,
was a very gracious figure.</p>

<p>The play was curiously uneven.
If one might be permitted to enter
and leave at one's pleasure I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span>advise you to miss out the desultory
First Act. But if you insist on seeing it
then take care to read your programme
before the lights go down and find out
that the scene is the porch of a church.
I thought all the time that it was the
porch of a theatre. Make sure in the
same way about the Chelsea flat, or
you may mistake it for a charming
country cottage. The Second and Third
Acts are not to be missed on any
account, but I shouldn't worry about
the Fourth. In the Fifth you should
go away for good the moment that the
dustman makes his exit. The tedium
that follows is most distressing, and
can only be explained as the author's
revenge for your laughter. It was a
cruel thing to do.</p>

<p>But I forgive him. I take away
many delightful memories of my evening
with <i>Pygmalion</i>, and, best of all,
the picture of Sir <span class="sc">Herbert's</span> frank and
childlike pleasure at having discovered
Mr. <span class="sc">Bernard Shaw</span>.</p>

<p>If you have ever been to an American
commercial drama, you will know the
opening scene of this one before the
curtain goes up. The business interior;
the typewriter on the left; the head of
the firm opening cryptic correspondence
and dictating unintelligible answers;
spasmodic incursions of cocksure buyers
and bagmen; a prevailing air of smartness,
of hustle, of get-on-or-get-out. In
<i>The Melting Pot</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Zangwill</span> has
been creating a diversion with an
Hebraic theme, his hero being a refugee
from Kieff, where his family had perished
in a pogrom. This new variation
has occurred&mdash;independently, no doubt&mdash;to
the author of <i>Potash and Perlmutter</i>,
who has grafted it (including
the detail of the immigrant from Kieff)
on the old commercial stock, and done
very well indeed with his blend.</p>

<p>His two protagonists in the Teuton-American-Semitic
firm of "cloak and
suit" manufacturers that gives its title
to the play are extraordinarily alive.
I am but imperfectly acquainted with
this racial variety, but I can easily
recognise that Messrs. <span class="sc">Augustus Yorke</span>
and <span class="sc">Egbert Leonard</span>, who represent
the two partners, are gifted with the
most amazing powers of observation
and reproduction.</p>

<p>The pair are alike in their mercenary
tastes and in that loyalty which is
so fine a feature of the Jewish race,
and is here found in frequent conflict
with their commercial instincts. The
cruel wrench that their generosity
always costs them is a true measure of
its excellence. They quarrel alike over
details of business policy; but they
always stand together where profit
is obviously to be made by a common
attitude, or where they find themselves
in a tight corner. Yet the
author has preserved a nice distinction
between them. It is <i>Potash</i>,
the elder of the two, and encumbered
by fetters of domestic affection, who is
the weaker vessel, and commits the
indiscretions with whose issue he is
impotent to cope; it is <i>Perlmutter</i>,
with the quicker brains, contemptuous
but devoted, who throws all the blame
where it is due, yet stands by to share
the punishment.</p>

<p>I found their language and accent
rather hard to follow, a difficulty not
shared by the strong Jewish element in
an audience that was extremely quick
to appreciate the humour that kept
one always on the alert. It is profitless
to ask how much of the fun was
due to the things said and how much
to the manner of saying them. The
essential matter is that actors and
author between them gave us an unusually
good time, and I am much
obliged to them.</p>

<p>Apart from the leading characters,
the <i>Mrs. Potash</i> of Miss <span class="sc">Matilda
Cottrelly</span> was a most delightful study,
and the breezy methods of Mr. <span class="sc">Charles
Dickson</span> as a buyer and Mr. <span class="sc">Ezra
Matthews</span> as a salesman were effective
of their kind.</p>

<p>The plot, as usual in such plays, was
rather elementary. So, too, with the
love interest; but the right kind of
sentiment was not wanting in the very
human characters of <i>Potash</i> and <i>Perlmutter</i>.
For a rare moment or two
there was a break in our laughter and
tears were not far away.</p>

<p>My nephew Rupert has been spending part of his Easter
holidays with me. There is nothing like a boy of fifteen for
adding an atmosphere to a house&mdash;in which term I include
a garden. It is a special atmosphere, hard to define, but
quite unmistakable when you have once lived in it. It
is compounded of football, cricket, hockey&mdash;these are not
actual, but conversational&mdash;of visits to the stables, romps
with dogs in a library, tousled hair, muddy trousers, a
certain contempt for time, the loan of my collar-stud, an
insatiable desire to look through the back volumes of <i>Punch</i>,
long rides on a bicycle and an irresistible tendency of ink
to the fingers, presumably caused by the terrible duty of
writing letters to parents. There may be other ingredients,
but these are the chief. I am bound to add that he is a
very amiable boy, with a strong sense of humour, and that
he associates on very friendly terms with the little girls,
his cousins, who form the majority of this household, it
being quite understood that, for the time, they become boys
while he remains what he is.</p>

<p>The other morning Rupert evidently had something on
his mind. He made various half-hearted and thoroughly
unsuccessful efforts to leave the room, twiddled his cap in
his hands, tripped over the rug and finally spoke.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, Uncle Harry, for lending me your
bicycle."</p>

<p>"That's all right," I said. "You're very welcome to it.
It's a good thing for it to be used."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "but I shan't want it again."</p>

<p>"Tired of it?" I said. "Well, there's no compulsion."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that&mdash;thanks awfully&mdash;but it isn't that.
It's a ripping bicycle. I should like to ride it for ever,
but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, what is it? Out with it."</p>

<p>"I've got one of my own."</p>

<p>"One of your own!" I said. "How's that? You
hadn't got one yesterday."</p>

<p>"No, but I've got one now. I bought it this morning
at Hickleden. There's a bicycle shop there, and I heard
there was a good bicycle for sale cheap, so I went over this
morning and had a ride on it, and it suited me splendidly,
so I bought it, and I've got it here."</p>

<p>"Bought it?" I said. "That's all very well; but how
did you pay for it?"</p>

<p>"That," he said, "is where all the bother comes in."</p>

<p>"It generally does," I said. "Either you've got the
money, and then it seems such a waste; or you haven't
got it, and then it's a lifetime of misery. Debt, my boy,
is an awful thing."</p>

<p>"Don't rag, Uncle Harry; I've got the money all right."</p>

<p>"Then be a man and shell out."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that's just what I can't do. It's this way:
the price of the bicycle is five pounds seventeen and sixpence."</p>

<p>"And a very good price too."</p>

<p>"It's got three gears and a lamp and everything complete.
Well, I've got three pounds ten in the Post-Office
Savings Bank. I put it in in London."</p>

<p>"That's a good beginning, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Aunt Mary gave me a pound for my birthday,
and I put that in at the post-office here yesterday. It's
better not to keep pounds in your pocket."</p>

<p>"Quite right," I said; "we have now got to four pounds
ten."</p>

<p>"And Grandma sent me a pound this morning in a
postal-order."</p>

<p>"We're all but up to it now," I said. "The excitement
is becoming intense."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? And I've got the rest in shillings and sixpences
and coppers."</p>

<p>"Away you go, then, and pay for the bicycle."</p>

<p>"Ah, but it isn't as easy as all that. I can't get the
money out of the Post-Office."</p>

<p>"What," I said&mdash;"they won't let you have your own
money? They calmly take the savings of a lifetime and
then refuse to give them up?"</p>

<p>"I went round there this morning and they said
I'd put the money in in London and there were various
formalities to be gone through before I could draw it out
here."</p>

<p>"The official mind," I said, "delights in technicalities.
Let us see how you stand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>To save you from the silly game of playing drakes and ducks</p>
<p>You banked the cash in Middlesex&mdash;but asked for it in Bucks.</p>
</div> </div>

<p>Or we could put it in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>In order not to spend it all in lollipops and toffees</p>
<p>You gave it to the P. M. G. to keep it in his office.</p>
</div> </div>

<p>Or in this way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>You bought a three-gear bicycle because you had a will for it,</p>
<p>And now you've gone and fetched the thing and cannot pay the bill for it.</p>
</div> </div>

<p>Rupert, you're in the cart."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Uncle Harry," he said in an awestruck tone,
"that's poetry."</p>

<p>"Is it?" I said. "I just threw it off."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's poetry all right. It's got rhymes, you
know."</p>

<p>"Rupert," I said, "let us come back to plain prose and
consider your desperate financial situation. You cannot
get your three pounds ten."</p>

<p>"No, not yet."</p>

<p>"And Aunt Mary's pound?"</p>

<p>"They said that, being holiday time, that wouldn't have
got to headquarters yet."</p>

<p>"Gracious goodness," I said, "I never knew a savings
bank had so many pitfalls. The whole thing is too complicated
for my mind."</p>

<p>"It isn't really complicated," said Rupert. "It's quite
plain; but perhaps if you put it into poetry you'll understand
it better."</p>

<p>"Rupert," I said, "let us have no sarcasms. The thing
is too serious for that. You possess your grandmother's
pound in a postal-order and assorted coins to the amount
of seven and sixpence, total one pound seven and six, to
pay for a bicycle costing five pounds seventeen and sixpence.
In short, you are a bankrupt."</p>

<p>"But I shall get the money."</p>

<p>"That is what they all say."</p>

<p>Eventually the matter was arranged and the bicycle man
was satisfied. Rupert's correspondence with the Post
Office still continues. But his faith in that institution
has received a severe shock.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Dodo the Second</i> (<span class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</span>), by <span class="sc">E. F.
Benson</span>. Doesn't the very title-page sound like a leaf from
your dead past? I protest that for my own part I was
back on hearing it in the naughty nineties, the very
beginning of them indeed (the fact that I was also back in
the school-room did little to impair the thrill) and agog to
read the clever, audacious book that all the wonderful
people who lived in those days were talking about. And
behold! here they all are again&mdash;not the people who talked,
but the audacious characters. Only the trouble is that we
have all in the interval become so much more audacious
ourselves that their efforts in this kind seem to fail to
produce the old impression. This is by no means to say
that I didn't enjoy <i>Dodo the Second</i>. I enjoyed it very
much indeed; and so will you. For one thing, it was the
jolliest experience to recognize so many old friends&mdash;<i>Dodo</i>
herself (now of course the <i>Princess Waldenech</i>), and the
wicked <i>Prince</i>, and the rest of them. Of <i>Dodo</i> at least it
may be said, moreover, that she has matured credibly;
this middle-aging lady is exactly what the siren of twenty
years ago would have developed into, still beautiful, still
alluring, and still (I must add) capable of infecting everyone
else in a conversation with exactly her own trick of cheap
and rather fatiguing brilliance. Added to all this there
is now a new generation of characters, several of whom
are quite pleasant company; for them and for one very
impressive piece of descriptive work in the account of a
gathering storm, this Twenty Years After may be heartily
welcomed. Indeed one leaves <i>Dodo</i> of 1914 so vigorously
alive that I am not without hope of her turning up yet
again as a grandmother in 1934.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have discovered from <i>The Rebellion of Esther</i> (<span class="sc">Alston
Rivers</span>) why it is that my sympathies, usually at the disposal
of insurgents, are withheld from the Suffragette.
Anyone who is genuinely out to assert a principle, at the
cost of quarrelling with established authority, has a certain
merit of altruism which even the most law-abiding may
count as a mitigating circumstance, however unworthy the
end in view; but the egoism of a young lady (like Miss
<span class="sc">Margaret Legge's</span> heroine) who in whatever cause defies
all institutions with the latent motive of asserting herself
will induce even the most lawless to support warmly the
powers of suppression. <i>Miss Esther Ballinger</i> had a
number of real grievances, but her point of view was
typified in her attitude towards the illicit and incidental
motherhood of one of her acquaintances. Without hearing
the facts, she pronounced it to be "a courageous stand
against conventional morality," which it just possibly
might have proved to be upon enquiry, and by no means
a weak surrender to immediate desires, as much more
probably it was in fact. From my knowledge of <i>Esther</i>
she had but one reason for expressing this opinion, and
that was the personal pleasure of saying the unorthodox
thing, an element which accounts for much of the unconventionality
of that intellectual class of townsfolk figuring
broadcast in the book, and largely discounts the value of its
criticisms. I suspected the same flaw in her expressed
convictions on religious, political and feminist matters,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span>and I shouldn't be surprised to learn, though there is no
hint of it, that she stopped short of complete revolt in
her own big affair because she realized instinctively that
even a passionate pose may lose its attractions if it
has to be maintained for a lifetime. Miss <span class="sc">Margaret
Legge</span>, though alive to the young person's faults, regards
her as, on the whole, deep-thinking and right-minded;
and I would not for a moment have our personal
difference of opinion discourage anybody from reading a
carefully studied and ably written novel.</p>

<hr />

<p>The attitude of Militarist to Pacifist has the makings of a
very pretty comedy. When the Mystics (with the Friends
and the Tolstoians) were evangelical enough to preach their
message of peace even to the
point of non-resistance, they
were broadly scouted as sentimental
and idealistic idiots,
and reminded of a nature red
in tooth and claw rampant in
this most sordid of all possible
worlds. Now that the Rationalists
take up the case against
war from another end, they
are denounced as squalid souls,
with a greengrocer's outlook,
morbidly anxious about the
price of peas and potatoes, and
urged to remember that not by
bread alone doth man live. In
<i>The Foundations of International
Polity</i> (<span class="sc">Heinemann</span>), a
series of lectures developing
phases of the argument of the
Great Illusion, Mr. <span class="sc">Norman
Angell</span> incidentally deals with
this greengrocery business.
Nobody with knowledge of his
shrewd and vigorous method
will be surprised that without
bluster or rhetoric he establishes
a very clear verdict of
acquittal. One has always the
impression that the rationalist
in him is deliberately repressing
the mystic, lest his case be
weakened by a suspicion of
sentimentalism. For it must
be obvious that not a cold, still
less a squalid, but a generous
purpose alone could inspire the fervour that flashes between
the reasoned lines. When Mr. <span class="sc">Angell</span> pleads that policy is
directed towards "self-interest," an easily misunderstandable
pronouncement, it is no mean self-interest he has in
view but a quality of high civilising and social value. He
argues cogently that defence is not incompatible with, but
rather a part of, rational pacifism, which is the protest
against coercion; re-emphasises the difference between
soldiering and policing; and illustrates the essential
shallowness of that venerable tag, "Human nature doesn't
change," by pointing to the decay of the duello, and the
decline of the grill as a means of reasoning with heretics
and witches. Were this learned Clerk a politician (which
Heaven avert!), he would move for yet another increment
to the Supplementary Navy Estimates&mdash;to wit, the price
of a battleship to be expended in the distribution of this
fighting pacifist's books to all journalists, attach&eacute;s, clergymen,
bazaar-openers, club oracles, professors, head-masters
and other obvious people in both Germany and Britain.</p>

<hr />

<p>In his new satirical study of certain modern cranks and
their unpleasantness Mr. <span class="sc">Oliver Onions</span> has, I think,
allowed his bitterness to outrun his sense of proportion.
<i>A Crooked Mile</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) is a sequel to his earlier book,
<i>The Two Kisses</i>. We meet again those two young women,
<i>Dorothy</i> and <i>Amory</i>, and the natural characteristics that
they once presented seem now to be tortured into caricature.
<i>Amory</i> has indeed all my sympathy, so badgered is she by
Mr. <span class="sc">Onions</span>, so relentlessly forced into ignominious positions;
and I cannot feel, as I should do, that she would
have achieved those ignominies without Mr. <span class="sc">Onions'</span>
impelling hand behind her. I have myself considerable
sympathy for cranks, and perhaps that is why I regard Mr.
<span class="sc">Onions'</span> satire as a dry, gritty business. His humour is, of
course, always a delightful
thing, but here I fancy that he
has not drawn the true line
between comedy and farce,
between satire that preserves
the probabilities and indiscriminate
exaggeration. Of the
three Mr. <span class="sc">Onionses</span> who have
at different times given me
pleasure&mdash;the author of <i>Widdershins</i>,
the author of <i>In
Accordance with the Evidence</i>,
and the author of <i>Little Devil
Doubt</i>&mdash;I greatly prefer the
first. In <i>A Crooked Mile</i> there
is one chapter worthy of all
three of them&mdash;that chapter
where <i>Amory</i> discovers that
her lover is going away with
another woman. That is fine
work. For the rest I hope that
he will grow tired of his social
satire and soon give us again
some more of his delicate
imagination and fancy.</p>

<hr />

<p>What I felt about <i>The Girl
on the Green</i> (<span class="sc">Methuen</span>) was
that, however charming and
capable, she was not quite
likely, after but a few short
months of golf, to have put
up such a good fight in her
great match with the crack
amateur, <i>Jim Beverley</i>, who
was giving her a half. I
couldn't manage to believe it. However, that was not my
business, but <span class="sc">Mark Allerton's</span>. According to him, <i>Frank</i>
took her match to the last green, in spite of a number of
cats, headed by the Vicar's wife, who did their best to put
her off her game. Yes, you are right to presume that what
began as a single developed into a flirtsome, and that the
twain lived happily ever after in a nice little dormy house,
and that <i>Jim</i> bested the <span class="sc">Hiltons</span> and the <span class="sc">Ouimets</span>, while
<i>Frank</i> put permanently out of joint all the noses of all
the Misses <span class="sc">Leitch</span>. Those who not only play but talk,
dream, read and generally live for golf will, I can say
with confidence, be grateful to Mr. <span class="sc">Mark Allerton</span> for
this easy, hopeful narrative.</p>
